Parent Area;Premotor Cortex;The premotor cortex is an area of the motor cortex lying within the frontal lobe of the brain just anterior to the primary motor cortex. It occupies part of Brodmann's area 6. It has been studied mainly in primates, including monkeys and humans. The functions of the premotor cortex are diverse and not fully understood. It projects directly to the spinal cord and therefore may play a role in the direct control of behavior, with a relative emphasis on the trunk muscles of the body.

Prefrontal Cortex;Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC or DL-PFC) is an area in the prefrontal cortex of the primate brain. It is one of the most recently derived parts of the human brain. It undergoes a prolonged period of maturation which lasts into adulthood.[1] The DLPFC is not an anatomical structure, but rather a functional one.

Prefrontal Cortex;Ventromedial prefrontal cortex;Evidence shows that the dmPFC plays several roles in humans. The dmPFC is identified to play roles in processing a sense of self, integrating social impressions, theory of mind, morality judgments, empathy, decision making, altruism, fear and anxiety information processing, and top-down motor cortex inhibition [7][8][9][10] [11] The dmPFC also modulates or regulates emotional responses and heart rate in situations of fear or stress and plays a role in long-term memory [1][4]). Some argue that the dmPFC is made up of several smaller subregions that are more task-specific.[12] The dmPFC is attributed with many roles in the brain. Despite this, there is no definitive understanding of the exact role dmPFC plays, and the underlying mechanisms giving rise to its function(s) in the brain remain to be seen.; amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex;0;0;0;0
Parietal Lobe;Primary somatosensory cortex;"In neuroanatomy, the primary somatosensory cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus of the brain's parietal lobe, and is part of the somatosensory system. It was initially defined from surface stimulation studies of Wilder Penfield, and parallel surface potential studies of Bard, Woolsey, and Marshall. Although initially defined to be roughly the same as Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2, more recent work by Kaas has suggested that for homogeny with other sensory fields only area 3 should be referred to as ""primary somatosensory cortex"", as it receives the bulk of the thalamocortical projections from the sensory input fields.[1"; Secondary somatosensory cortex, Thalamus;0;0;0;0

Parietal Lobe;Posterior Parietal Cortex;Damage to the posterior parietal cortex can produce a variety of sensorimotor deficits, including deficits in the perception and memory of spatial relationships, inaccurate reaching and grasping, in the control of eye movement, and inattention. The two most striking consequences of PPC damage are apraxia and hemispatial neglect.[1]; premotor cortex, Primary somatosensory cortex, V3;0;0;0;0
Occipital Lobe;V1;The primary visual cortex is the most studied visual area in the brain. In mammals, it is located in the posterior pole of the occipital lobe and is the simplest, earliest cortical visual area. It is highly specialized for processing information about static and moving objects and is excellent in pattern recognition.[clarification needed]; V2, Thalamus;0;0;0;0
Occipital Lobe;V2;Visual area V2, or secondary visual cortex, also called prestriate cortex,[26] is the second major area in the visual cortex, and the first region within the visual association area. It receives strong feedforward connections from V1 (direct and via the pulvinar) and sends strong connections to V3, V4, and V5. It also sends strong feedback connections to V1; V3, V4, V5, V6, V1;0;0;0;0
Occipital Lobe;V3;"The term third visual complex refers to the region of cortex located immediately in front of V2, which includes the region named visual area V3 in humans. The ""complex"" nomenclature is justified by the fact that some controversy still exists regarding the exact extent of area V3, with some researchers proposing that the cortex located in front of V2 may include two or three functional subdivisions. For example, David Van Essen and others (1986) have proposed the existence of a 'dorsal' V3 in the upper part of the cerebral hemisphere, which is distinct from the ""ventral V3"" (or ventral posterior area, VP) located in the lower part of the brain. Dorsal and ventral V3 have distinct connections with other parts of the brain, appear different in sections stained with a variety of methods, and contain neurons that respond to different combinations of visual stimulus (for example, colour-selective neurons are more common in the ventral V3). Additional subdivisions, including V3A and V3B have also been reported in humans. These subdivisions are located near dorsal V3, but do not adjoin V2."; V5, Posterior Parietal Cortex, V2;0;0;0;0
Occipital Lobe;V4;V4 is the third cortical area in the ventral stream, receiving strong feedforward input from V2 and sending strong connections to the PIT. It also receives direct input from V1, especially for central space. In addition, it has weaker connections to V5 and dorsal prelunate gyrus (DP). Like V2, V4 is tuned for orientation, spatial frequency, and color. Unlike V2, V4 is tuned for object features of intermediate complexity, like simple geometric shapes, although no one has developed a full parametric description of the tuning space for V4. Visual area V4 is not tuned for complex objects such as faces, as areas in the inferotemporal cortex are.; inferior temporal cortex, V2;0;0;0;0
Temporal Lobe;V5;The middle temporal visual area (MT or V5) is a region of extrastriate visual cortex. In several species of both New World monkeys and Old World monkeys the MT area contains a high concentration of direction-selective neurons.[46] The MT in primates is thought to play a major role in the perception of motion, the integration of local motion signals into global percepts, and the guidance of some eye movements.[46]; Posterior Parietal Cortex, V1, V2, V3;0;0;0;0
Temporal Lobe;Auditory Cortex;The auditory cortex is the part of the temporal lobe that processes auditory information in humans and many other vertebrates. It is a part of the auditory system, performing basic and higher functions in hearing, such as possible relations to language switching.[1][2] It is located bilaterally, roughly at the upper sides of the temporal lobes ‚Äì in humans, curving down and onto the medial surface, on the superior temporal plane, within the lateral sulcus and comprising parts of the transverse temporal gyri, and the superior temporal gyrus, including the planum polare and planum temporale ; Prefrontal Cortex, Thalamus;0;0;0;0
Temporal Lobe;Inferior temporal gyrus;The inferior temporal gyrus is one of three gyri of the temporal lobe and is located below the middle temporal gyrus, connected behind with the inferior occipital gyrus, it also extends around the infero-lateral border on to the inferior surface of the temporal lobe, where it is limited by the inferior sulcus. This region is one of the higher levels of the ventral stream of visual processing, associated with the representation of objects, places, faces, and colors.[1][2] It may also be involved in face perception,[3] and in the recognition of numbers and words.[4][5; hippocampus, amygdala, V4;0;0;0;0
Temporal Lobe;Fusiform Face area;The fusiform face area (FFA, meaning spindle-shaped face area) is a part of the human visual system (while also activated in people blind from birth[1]) that is specialized for facial recognition.[2] It is located in the inferior temporal cortex (IT), in the fusiform gyrus (Brodmann area 37).; hippocampus, V4;0;0;0;0
Neocortex;Insular Cortex;The insular cortex (also insula and insular lobe) is a portion of the cerebral cortex folded deep within the lateral sulcus (the fissure separating the temporal lobe from the parietal and frontal lobes) within each hemisphere of the mammalian brain. The insulae are believed to be involved in consciousness and play a role in diverse functions usually linked to emotion or the regulation of the body's homeostasis. These functions include compassion, empathy, taste, perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning, interpersonal experience, and awareness of homeostatic emotions such as hunger, pain and fatigue. In relation to these, it is involved in psychopathology. ; Amygdala, Prefrontal Cortex;0;0;0;0
Neocortex;Cingulate Cortex;The cingulate cortex is a part of the cerebral cortex that plays a crucial role in various cognitive and emotional processes. It is involved in attention, emotional regulation, decision-making, and memory. This region is interconnected with several other brain areas, facilitating its role in integrating information from different systems.; Basal Ganglia, Thalamus;0;0;0;0
Cingulate Cortex;Anterior cingulate cortex;The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), located in the frontal part of the cingulate cortex, is pivotal for cognitive control, emotional regulation, pain perception, and social cognition. It monitors conflicts, aids in decision-making, and detects errors while also processing emotions, especially related to pain, empathy, and social interactions. Connected to various brain regions like the prefrontal cortex, limbic system, and insular cortex, the ACC's dysfunctions are linked to conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD, and chronic pain syndromes, emphasizing its critical role in shaping complex human behaviors and experiences.; premotor cortex, Prefrontal cortex, Thalamus;0;0;0;0
Cingulate Cortex;Posterior Cingulate Cortex;The PCC forms a central node in the default mode network of the brain. It has been shown to communicate with various brain networks simultaneously and is involved in diverse functions.[1] Along with the precuneus, the PCC has been implicated as a neural substrate for human awareness in numerous studies of both the anesthetized and vegetative (coma) states. Imaging studies indicate a prominent role for the PCC in pain and episodic memory retrieval.[2] Increased size of the ventral PCC is related to a decline in working memory performance.[3] The PCC has also been strongly implicated as a key part of several intrinsic control networks.[4]; orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, Thalamus;0;0;0;0
Cingulate Cortex;Retrosplenial cortex;The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a cortical area in the brain comprising Brodmann areas 29 and 30.[1] It is secondary association cortex, making connections with numerous other brain regions. The region's name refers to its anatomical location immediately behind the splenium of the corpus callosum in primates, although in rodents it is located more towards the brain surface and is relatively larger. Its function is currently not well understood, but its location close to visual areas and also to the hippocampal spatial/memory system suggest it may have a role in mediating between perceptual and memory functions,[2] particularly in the spatial domain.[3] However, its exact contribution to either space or memory processing has been hard to pin down.[4]; Hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, Thalamus;0;0;0;0
